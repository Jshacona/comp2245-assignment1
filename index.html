        <p> I am 22 years old, and I am currently studying at the University of the West Indies pursuing a bachelors degree in computer science. Outside of studying and completing assignments, I enjoy braiding, doing makeup and spending time with my family and friends. My interests in Web Development are solely for educational purposes to see how best I can use the knowledge I gain from this class, and apply it to my other areas of study.</p>
